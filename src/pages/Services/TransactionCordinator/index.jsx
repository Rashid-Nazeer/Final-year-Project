                            content=" Transaction coordinators (TCs) in real estate manage the paperwork
              and communication needed to ensure a smooth closing process. They
              handle deadlines, contracts, and compliance, acting as a bridge
              between buyers, sellers, agents, lenders, and title companies.
              There are two main types of transaction coordinators: Traditional
              Real Estate TCs – These coordinators work on standard real estate
              deals, ensuring contracts, disclosures, inspections, and financing
              are completed on time. They typically assist agents handling
              conventional home sales, financed deals, and cash purchases.
              Creative Real Estate TCs – These specialize in unconventional
              transactions like Subject-To (Sub2) deals, lease options, seller
              financing, and wholesaling. They navigate unique legal and
              financial structures, ensuring that all agreements are correctly
              documented and compliant while coordinating with attorneys, escrow
              officers, and sellers. Both types of TCs play a crucial role in
              keeping transactions organized, reducing stress for investors and
              agents while ensuring deals close efficiently."
